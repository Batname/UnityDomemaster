UnityDomemaster
===============

Domemaster package for Unity. 
Updated for Unity 5. Now works with free version.

To use: 
1. Import the "Domemaster" package.
2. Drag the "Domemaster" prefab to the scene.
3. Drag the "DomeCamera" prefab to the scene.

The DomeCamera script automatically links to the camera which has the default tag "MainCamera". Alternatively, you can link the camera by assigning the "Target" property of the DomeCamera script.

The Domemaster object can be positioned anywhere.

Sprite-based particles and other effects do not render correctly.
